# unit-4-game

The game is a very simplistic Hero vs Villain RPG
You begin by selecting 1 of 4 heroes
Next you select your enemy
By clicking the "FIGHT!" button the two characters will attack each other until one is defeated (Player has initiative)
Once the Villain is defeated you select a new villain and repeat until all 3 are defeated.
The players attacked will increase by it's base amount after every attack while the defenders damage stays the same (different base stats for each character.)
Once all 3 Villains are defeated the player wins, if the Player's HP reaches 0 they lose.
